bash-examples
=============

Bash examples using classroom concepts but without direct lab answers

---

A few header lines to explain why I sometimes use different ones:

```bash
#!/bin/bash             # Standard location in most Linux distros
#!/usr/bin/bash         # Cygwin's edition isn't quite the same
#!/usr/local/bin/bash   # Nor are OpenBSD/FreeBSD systems
#!/usr/pkg/bin/bash     # Nor are NetBSD systems
#!/usr/bin/env bash     # One #! to rule them all: basically a $(which bash)
```
